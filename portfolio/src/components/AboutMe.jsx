        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="text-left py-8 text-xl text-stone-500">
        I’m a Software Engineer with a background in full-stack development, cloud-based applications, 
        and machine learning. After earning my B.S. in Computer Science from Western Governors University 
        and completing immersive training programs at Flatiron School and Infosys, I’ve built projects showcasing 
        front-end design and back-end development.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Before entering tech, I served as an Auxiliary Police Officer and led teams in high-pressure environments 
        as a Lead Security Officer at a Level One Trauma Center. Those experiences sharpened my communication, 
        problem-solving, and leadership skills—qualities I now bring to collaborative engineering teams.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I’m passionate about building clean, user-focused solutions and continuously expanding my technical expertise. 
        I also plan to pursue a Master’s in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in machine learning, 
        to deepen my ability to create innovative, data-driven solutions.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I’m seeking opportunities to contribute to real-world software development while learning from strong technical mentors.
