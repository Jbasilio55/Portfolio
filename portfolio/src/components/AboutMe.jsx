        About Me
      </h1>
      <p className="text-center py-8 text-xl text-stone-500">
        Aspiring software engineer with a strong foundation in Java, Ruby on
        Rails, and JavaScript-based programming. My approach to problem-solving
        is both creative and meticulous, and I thrive in team-based settings,
        consistently offering reliability, adaptability, and an insatiable
        curiosity to learn and innovate. My diverse background in security
        management and law enforcement has furnished me with significant
        leadership acumen, an exceptional eye for detail, and the capacity to
        communicate effectively and resolve issues within high-pressure
        contexts. I am currently on the cusp of earning a Bachelor of Science
        degree in Computer Science and have fortified my technical arsenal
        through attending the renowned Flatiron coding bootcamp and an intensive
        Java Application Development course sponsored by Infosys. As I continue
        to evolve professionally, I remain deeply committed to harnessing my
        skills and experiences to craft impactful and high-performing software
        solutions that meet and exceed expectations.
